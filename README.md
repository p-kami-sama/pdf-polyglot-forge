# pdf-polyglot-forge
A research-oriented toolkit for generating PDF polyglots that embed Bash, Python, and Ruby payloads. This project provides multiple merging strategies (prepend, append, middle injection) and supports clean formatting, and header preservation. Designed for digital forensics, malware analysis research, and polyglot study—not for malicious use.
